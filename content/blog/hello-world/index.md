This is my first post on Js function! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[Javascript function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp).

> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
> A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
> A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()
> The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
> (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
> Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
> Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked
> Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

You can also write code blocks here!

```js
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

| Important Points |
| :--------------- |


> The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

> | 1 | When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button) |

> | 2 | When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code |

> | 3 | Automatically (self invoked) |

    Why Functions?

# You can reuse code:

## Define the code once, and use it many times.

> Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

- split

- UpperCase
- LowerCase
